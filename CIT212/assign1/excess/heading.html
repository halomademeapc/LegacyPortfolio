<title>Are Mirror Lenses Worth Using?</title>

<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<p>Mirror lenses are fairly cheap and allow you to have a very long effective focal lenth with a relatively small body.  However, they have terrible donut-shaped bokeh that is very unappealing.  They make for some good fun as more of toy lenses and you can get good enough results with them if your budget is really strict, but for professional work they should be avoided.  </p>
