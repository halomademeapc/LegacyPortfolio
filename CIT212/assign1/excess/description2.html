<h1>Character Skills in <i>Victory</i></h1>
<d1>
	<dt>Combo Skills</dt>
		<dd>Combo skills are a characters normal attack sequence.  Break attacks focus on lowering the enemy's guard, power attacks focus on dealing high amounts of damage, and rush attacks focus on accumulating a high hit count.</dd>
	<dt>EX Finishes</dt>
    	<dd>EX finishes can be performed at the end of a combo.  Which ones are available depend on the current level of your EXE gauge.  Using these attacks does not deplete the EXE gauge.  They act more as a bonus for keeping the gauge filled. </dd>
    <dt>SP Skills</dt>
    	<dd>SP Skills can be performed instead of combos in battle.  These actions consume SP and can be used to attack enemies or apply status effects to participants in battle.</dd>
  	<dt>EXE Drive</dt>
    	<dd>EXE drive attacks are the most powerful moves available to a character.  They consume 1-3 bars from the EXE gauge and delay the character's next turn.</dd>
