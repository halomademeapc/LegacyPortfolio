				<div class="titleImage"><img src="images/creations/exponent/head.svg" alt="All Tapped Out: Why ITaP Computers Feel So Slow and What ITaP is Doing to Fix it"></div>
				<div class="author">By Alex Griffith | Graphics Editor</div>
				<div class="date">Friday, October 9, 2015 10:00 am</div>
				<p>It seems to be a widely-accepted idea that school computers tend to be sluggish. However, despite their notoriety for
					seeming so slow that one might feel a Dorito would offer better performance than whatever chips are inside the system,
					many students and faculty rely on them daily to perform their studies.</p>
				<p>A popular location for computer usage and one that receives a particularly high volume of complaints regarding login
					times and application startup speeds is Hicks Undergraduate Library. I paid a visit to the labs there to run some tests
					and see what might be responsible for the subpar user experience.</p>
				<p>The PC’s running Windows in the main area of Hicks are fairly new systems and actually have pretty decent specifications.
					They’re packing fourth-generation Intel Core-i5 processors, ample amounts of memory and fairly typical hard drives.
					The computers performed exactly as one would expect based on their specifications. Distinctly typical, but not bad at
					all.
				</p>
				<div class="artgallery">
					<div class="artgraphic"><img src="images/creations/exponent/spec.svg" alt="Specifications of test computer: Core-i5 4570 (4 cores at 3.2GHz), 8GB DDR3 1600 MHz RAM, Toshiba 1TB 7200rpm HDD"></div>
					<div class="artgraphic"><img src="images/creations/exponent/mark.svg" alt="CrystalMark Scores"></div>
				</div>
				<p>Note: If you aren’t familiar with bits and bytes, they’re size measurements for data on computers. A byte is eight bits,
					and speeds are expressed in bps (bits per second) and Bps (bytes per second).</p>
				<p>One of the biggest differences between logging on to a personal computer and logging on to an ITaP computer is that personal
					computers store all user content locally – all of your stuff is right there on the computer for it to pull in during
					startup. ITaP stores all of your files and settings on a remote server that their computers have to pull in over the
					network connection to log you in. I was surprised to find that despite having gigabit Ethernet ports built-in, these
					computers were using much older and slower 100 megabit-per-second connections. This meant that access to remote storage
					was capped out at a maximum of a measly one-sixtieth of the 6 Gbps available to internal hard drives over their SATA
					connections.
				</p>
				<p>Mechanical hard drives come nowhere near saturating the 6 Gbps available over SATA, so to assess the performance of these
					two storage locations, I ran a few passes of CrystalDiskMark, which reads and writes 1GB to test drives both sequentially
					(as a single file for faster performance), and randomly (broken down into small pieces and spread around the drive to
					illustrate more realistic performance) while measuring transfer speeds.</p>
				<div class="artgallery">
					<div class="artgraphic"><img src="images/creations/exponent/band.svg" alt="Third-Generation SATA operates at 6Gbps while CAT-5 runs at 100 Mbps"></div>
					<div class="artgraphic"><img src="images/creations/exponent/disk.svg" alt="Drive performance comparing local disk to network drive on test PC"></div>
				</div>
				<p>The results were interesting. The network drive capped out at around the 10-12 MBps mark on each test, indicating that
					the remote drive itself has very solid performance but is being bottlenecked by the 100 Mbps connection to the computer.
					The hard drive, on the other hand, had typical sequential read speeds, fairly poor sequential write speeds and abysmal
					random speeds. It’s perfectly normal for random speeds to be much slower than sequential ones because the head inside
					the hard drive has to physically move back and forth a lot during that kind of operation, but the performance of the
					hard drive in this instance was exceptionally bad. Both read and write for random operations were under 1 MBps. For
					comparison, a DVD being read at 1X speed reads at 1.4 MBps. It’s really that slow. Given that the majority of startup
					operations are random reads, it’s no wonder the login process takes so long.</p>
				<p>Speaking of startup times, I experimented a bit to see how changing the amount of user data on my ITaP profile would
					impact startup. I artificially inflated my profile from its original 686 MB to 5 GB and then back down as small as I
					could get it to 49 MB and measured the impact on startup time.</p>
				<div class="artgraphic"><img src="images/creations/exponent/boot.svg" alt="Comparing startup time with varying profile sizes"></div>
				<p>Reducing the profile size did shorten login times somewhat, but even after deleting practically everything, the login
					process still took a total of 2 minutes and 30 seconds. The network speed plays into startup speed, but most of the
					responsibility for booting lies in local storage.</p>
				<p>I spoke to Byron Reed, director of learning spaces for ITaP, to find out what their stance on the issue was. He explained
					that there had been an issue with the computer manufacturer putting inconsistent hard drive models in workstations that
					were supposed to be identical. More interestingly, he revealed that ITaP has plans to upgrade many computers in the
					area.
				</p>
				<p>“We have a timeline. We’ve identified about six hundred machines that would benefit greatly from doing this and are starting
					some of those machines Monday. We’ll probably get a couple hundred done Monday and Tuesday… but the other four hundred
					will continue throughout the semester,” said Reed. The planned changes include upgrading older computers with only 4
					GB of memory to 8 GB and adding SanDisk 250 GB solid-state drives to workstations throughout campus.</p>
				<p>Solid-state drives greatly outperform traditional hard drives in terms of speed but cost more and generally have much
					lower capacities. A select few computers in Hicks have already been upgraded as part of a testing process, so I was
					able to see the improvements firsthand.</p>
				<div class="artgraphic"><img src="images/creations/exponent/solid.svg" alt="Performance gains after SSD upgrade"></div>
				<p>Needless to say, the hardware upgrades resulted in significantly shorter startup times. With these changes rolling out
					on a wide scale in the very near future, Boilermakers can expect to spend more time getting work done and less time
					watching circles spin.</p>
