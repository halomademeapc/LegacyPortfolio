                    I participated in the company’s first-ever hackathon. There was an insurance theme and 8 teams participated. Our team won
                    second place for our simplified quoting concept that uses existing data from within the company and other
                    sources to deliver demographics-driven quotes to potential customers while asking far less questions
                    than would normally be required.

                    My part time work with Indiana Farm Bureau Insurance developed into another full-time internship. This year, I worked as
                    a full-fledged employee as I had been with the company long enough to become acclimated to the environment.
                    In addition to standard support, I led the charge on an overhaul of our device deployment process by
                    integrating the Microsoft Deployment toolkit with our Configuration Manager installation, integrating
                    firmware updates and application installations dynamically into the task sequences, and automating several
                    other tasks that previously had to be performed manually. I developed a PowerShell script to check for
                    VPN connection and remap users’ network drives when appropriate and deployed it alongside an upgrade
                    to our Cisco AnyConnect client. I facilitated the removal of all McAfee products from our environment
                    of over 2,000 devices and headed the desktop-end transition to CrowdStrike and Microsoft BitLocker Administration
                    and Monitoring. I established a standard process for deploying software with Configuration Manager’s
                    application model, packaged over 30 pieces of software, and provided documentation and training to other
                    members of the team. I created group policy for Windows Hello and other application-specific needs. I
                    also created task sequences and laid the groundwork for conducting bi-annual operating system upgrades
                    to Windows 10 clients. I also filmed and edited a promotion video for the program as part of a project,
                    which you can view via the link below.

                    This internship focused a lot on the business aspect of software and testing to make sure that everything works they way
                    that a user would expect. During this 11-week program, I worked primarily on testing for an invoice redesign
                    project. I also created test plans for Windows 10 deployment, development of a new site, and future mobile
                    device development. During the internship, I and the 11 other interns were taken on several field trips
                    to learn more about the insurance industry and interact with real customers. You can see photos below.

                    The business has a low-tech approach to learning, focusing on learning to think quickly rather than relying
                    on technology. This was a great opportunity to experience working with children and a far better understanding
                    the type of business that might resist technological change.

                    The Net is a young adults group that meets every other Sunday. I assist with set-up, create visual elements and loops, and
                    manage the on-screen lyrics and notes during the service.

                    As Graphics Editor, I managed a team of roughly 10 artists. I was responsible for ensuring that articles in the paper had
                    proper visuals to accompany them. I worked against regular deadlines to oversee my team, create graphics
                    for print, design page layouts, film coverage videos, and develop website assets. See some of my work
                    under the "creations" portion of the website.
