    This internship focused a lot on the business aspect of software and testing to make sure that everything works they way that a user would expect.  During this 11-week program, I worked primarily on testing for an invoice redesign project.  I also created test plans for Windows 10 deployment, development of a new site, and future mobile device development.  During the course of the internship, I and the 11 other interns were taken on several field trips to learn more about the insurance industry and interact with real customers.  You can see photos below.

    During the spring semester at IUPUI, I worked at Kumon of Brownsburg, a learning facility that specializes in Math and Reading.  The business has a low-tech approach to learning, focusing on learning to think quickly rather than relying on technology.  This was a great opportunity to experience working with children and a far better understanding the type of business that might resist technological change.

    As Graphics Editor, I managed a team of roughly 10 artists.  I was responsible for enuring that articles in the paper had proper visuals to accompany them.  I worked against regular deadlines to oversee my team, create graphics for print, design page layouts, film coverage videos, and develop website assets.
